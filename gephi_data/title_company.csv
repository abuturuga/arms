We’re different in the way we work and the way we breed success. We’ve got a dog that roams the office, hangout rooms and one of our Directors comes into the office playing the ukulele occasionally. Office culture is important to us – it’s one of the reasons for our success and without it, we wouldn’t be where we are now. We started life in a bedroom in the northwest of England but in ten years we’ve been able to dominate the motorcycle insurance industry, establish ourselves in van insurance and take a foothold in the car insurance industry.  Collaboration is key to the success of vast:visibility – if our analysts don’t talk to our creatives and our creatives don’t talk to our tech teams, we’re not getting anything done. That’s why everyone’s encouraged to throw out ideas, why strategy meetings feature all parts of the company and why we get everyone together for an annual four day team building extravaganza (not to mention plenty of days and nights out in between).  The Vast Visibility Limited Liverpool Branch in Iasi is the technology development center of the business, delivering not only the platforms that have powered millions of quotes for motorbike, van, car, caravan and motorhome insurance quotes but also all of the suite of management information tools and control systems that sit around those platforms. Based in Iasi (Romania) and Liverpool (UK) since 2006, the business has gone from strength to strength. We pride ourselves on being innovators, leading the market by bringing new features and ways of comparing to our customers. In addition to supporting the ‘in house’ brands, The Bike Insurer and The Van Insurer, the company also provides platforms for major third party brands such as Confused.com, Asda, Autotrader, Admiral, MCN, Mustard.co.uk and more. In November 2016 the Group secured a strategic investment from fintech investor HgCapital.  This investment will further enhance the business’ capability to deliver not only its core aggregation services but will also unlock an exciting suite of innovative digital solutions including data enrichment, analytics, fraud detection and advertising platforms to the wider market. The business is currently 90 people strong (with c60 in Iasi, Romania) and is looking to extend its world class, commercially orientated team to fully unlock and extend both the capabilities of its market leading technology solutions and also the full potential of its ‘white label’ capabilities."}"
